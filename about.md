I am an undergraduate student studying Information Technology in K.J Somaiya College Of Engineering, Mumbai.I started development from my freshman year, since then I am hooked to it. When exploring, I realised that there are millions of things to pursue. Cutting the confusion, I finally came across field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision and found it very intriguing. I intent to pursure my career in these fields.

I consider watching movies, Swimming,playing Table Tennis as my hobbies.
