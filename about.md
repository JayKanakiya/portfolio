I am Jay, an undergraduate student studying Information Technology in K.J Somaiya College Of Engineering, Mumbai. I started development from my freshman year, since then I am hooked. Currently, I am exploring the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

I consider watching movies, swimming, playing table tennis as my pastimes.

Email me for any opportunities in the fields of my interest.
