I am Jay, an undergraduate student studying Information Technology in K.J Somaiya College Of Engineering, Mumbai. I started development from my freshman year, since then I am hooked. When exploring, I realised that there are millions of things to pursue. Cutting the confusion, I finally came across field of Deep Learning and Computer Vision and found it very intriguing. I intend to pursure my career in these fields.

I consider watching movies, swimming, playing table tennis as my pastimes.

Email me for any opportunities in the fields of my interest.
